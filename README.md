## Introduction
This guide helps you configure tests using Sentinel to govern your Terraform stacks.

## Getting Started
1. Login to [app.terraform.io](https://app.terraform.io)
2. Go to the [tutorial on setting up Terraform Cloud](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/cloud-sign-up?in=terraform/cloud-get-started).
3. Follow the steps up until the [input variable set](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/cloud-create-variable-set?in=terraform/cloud-get-started) section. Populate your ocid, fingerprint, region, tenancy ocid, and private key by gathering the inputs from your OCI Console. For the private key, download a private key pem file and input the contents of the file as the value. <br/><br/>

4. Fork this repo. Create a new workspace and choose the Version control workflow. Point your workspace at the forked repo.
5. Run a terraform apply within your workspace dashboard. <br/><br/>

## Configuring Sentinel

1. Referencing the [enforce policy set guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/policy-quickstart?in=terraform/cloud-get-started) go to settings, select `policy sets`, and click `connect new policy set`.
2. Select your forked repo again and for the path enter "oci" since that is the name of the directory where the tests live.
3. Select "Policies enforced on select workspaces" and specify your new workspace from the dropdown. Click the connect policy set button.
4. Try running a plan and apply on your Terraform code. You can modify your tests [enforcement levels](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/concepts/enforcement-levels) in the [sentinel.hcl](oci/sentinel.hcl) file. See how the tests behave when you remove tags from your resources or run a `terraform plan` after deleting resources from the `prohibited_list` (within the deletion.sentinel file).
5. Try adding additional checks i.e  [validate-variables-have-descriptions.sentinel](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-sentinel-policies/blob/main/cloud-agnostic/validate-variables-have-descriptions.sentinel).

### Prerequisites
* A Terraform Cloud Login
* An OCI Account
* An Oracle Cloud ocid, fingerprint, tenancy ocid, and private key

## Notes/Issues
* Sentinel requires a Team & Governance Terraform Cloud account.
* Once done with the tutorial, go ahead and [tear down your resources](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/cloud-destroy).
